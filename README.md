## Configuration for Amazon Elasticsearch Output Plugin

To run the Logstash Output Amazon Elasticsearch plugin, simply add a configuration following the below documentation.

An example configuration:

```
output {
	amazon_es {
		hosts => ["foo.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com"]
		region => "us-east-1"
		# aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key are optional if instance profile is configured
		aws_access_key_id => 'ACCESS_KEY'
		aws_secret_access_key => 'SECRET_KEY'
		index => "production-logs-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
	}
}
```

### Required Parameters

- hosts (array of string) - the Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain endpoint (e.g. `["foo.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com"]`)
- region (string, :default => "us-east-1") - region where the domain is located

### Optional Parameters

- Credential parameters:

  * aws_access_key_id, :validate => :string - optional AWS access key
  * aws_secret_access_key, :validate => :string - optional AWS secret key

	 The credential resolution logic can be described as follows:

	 - User passed `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` in `amazon_es` configuration
	 - Environment variables - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (RECOMMENDED since they are recognized by all the AWS SDKs and CLI except for .NET), or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` (only recognized by Java SDK)
	 - Credential profiles file at the default location (`~/.aws/credentials`) shared by all AWS SDKs and the AWS CLI
	 - Instance profile credentials delivered through the Amazon EC2 metadata service

- template (path) - You can set the path to your own template here, if you so desire. If not set, the included template will be used.
- template_name (string, default => "logstash") - defines how the template is named inside Elasticsearch
- port (string, default 443) - Amazon Elasticsearch Service listens on port 443 for HTTPS (default) and port 80 for HTTP. Tweak this value for a custom proxy.
- protocol (string, default https) - The protocol used to connect to the Amazon Elasticsearch Service

## Developing

### 1. Plugin Development and Testing

#### Code

1. To get started, you'll need JRuby with the Bundler gem installed.

2. Create a new plugin or clone and existing from the GitHub [logstash-plugins](https://github.com/logstash-plugins) organization. [Example plugins](https://github.com/logstash-plugins?query=example) exist.

3. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```

#### Test

1. Update your dependencies:

   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```

2. Run unit tests:

   ```sh
   bundle exec rspec
   ```

### 2. Running your unpublished plugin in Logstash

#### 2.1 Run in a local Logstash clone

1. Edit Logstash `Gemfile` and add the local plugin path, for example:

   ```ruby
   gem "logstash-filter-awesome", :path => "/your/local/logstash-filter-awesome"
   ```

2. Install the plugin:

   ```sh
   # Logstash 2.3 and higher
   bin/logstash-plugin install --no-verify

   # Prior to Logstash 2.3
   bin/plugin install --no-verify
   ```

3. Run Logstash with your plugin:

   ```sh
   bin/logstash -e 'filter {awesome {}}'
   ```

At this point any modifications to the plugin code will be applied to this local Logstash setup. After modifying the plugin, simply re-run Logstash.

#### 2.2 Run in an installed Logstash

Before build your `Gemfile`, please make sure use JRuby. Here is how you can know your local Ruby version:

```sh
rvm list
```

Please make sure you current using JRuby. Here is how you can change to JRuby

```sh
rvm jruby
```

You can use the same **2.1** method to run your plugin in an installed Logstash by editing its `Gemfile` and pointing the `:path` to your local plugin development directory. You can also build the gem and install it using:

1. Build your plugin gem:

   ```sh
   gem build logstash-filter-awesome.gemspec
   ```

2. Install the plugin from the Logstash home:

   ```sh
   # Logstash 2.3 and higher
   bin/logstash-plugin install --no-verify

   # Prior to Logstash 2.3
   bin/plugin install --no-verify
   ```

3. Start Logstash and test the plugin.
