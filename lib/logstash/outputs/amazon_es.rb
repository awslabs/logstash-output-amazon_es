# This output plugin emits data to Amazon Elasticsearch with support for signing requests using AWS V4 Signatures
#
#
# The configuration and experience is similar to logstash-output-elasticsearch plugin and we have added Signature V4 support for the same
# Some of the default configurations like connection timeouts have been tuned for optimal performance with Amazon Elasticsearch
#
# ==== Retry Policy
#
# This plugin uses the same retry policy as logstash-output-elasticsearch, It uses bulk API to optimize its
# imports into Elasticsearch.. These requests may experience either partial or total failures.
# Events are retried if they fail due to either a network error or the status codes
# 429 (the server is busy), 409 (Version Conflict), or 503 (temporary overloading/maintenance).
#
# The retry policy's logic can be described as follows:
#
# - Block and retry all events in the bulk response that experience transient network exceptions until
#   a successful submission is received by Elasticsearch.
# - Retry the subset of sent events which resulted in ES errors of a retryable nature.
# - Events which returned retryable error codes will be pushed onto a separate queue for
#   retrying events. Events in this queue will be retried a maximum of 5 times by default (configurable through :max_retries).
#   The size of this queue is capped by the value set in :retry_max_items.
# - Events from the retry queue are submitted again when the queue reaches its max size or when
#   the max interval time is reached. The max interval time is configurable via :retry_max_interval.
# - Events which are not retryable or have reached their max retry count are logged to stderr.

  # and it has been more than `idle_flush_time` seconds since the last flush,

  # What does each action do?
  #
  # - index: indexes a document (an event from Logstash).
  # - delete: deletes a document by id
  # - create: indexes a document, fails if a document by that id already exists in the index.
  # - update: updates a document by id
  # following action is not supported by HTTP protocol
  #
