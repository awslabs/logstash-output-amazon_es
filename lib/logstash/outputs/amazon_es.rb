# .Compatibility Note
# [NOTE]
# ================================================================================
# Starting with Elasticsearch 5.3, there's an {ref}modules-http.html[HTTP setting]
# called `http.content_type.required`. If this option is set to `true`, and you
# are using Logstash 2.4 through 5.2, you need to update the Elasticsearch output
# plugin to version 6.2.5 or higher.
# 
# ================================================================================
#
# This plugin is the recommended method of storing logs in Elasticsearch.
# If you plan on using the Kibana web interface, you'll want to use this output.
#
# This output only speaks the HTTP protocol. HTTP is the preferred protocol for interacting with Elasticsearch as of Logstash 2.0.
# We strongly encourage the use of HTTP over the node protocol for a number of reasons. HTTP is only marginally slower,
# yet far easier to administer and work with. When using the HTTP protocol one may upgrade Elasticsearch versions without having
# to upgrade Logstash in lock-step. 
# 
# You can learn more about Elasticsearch at <https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>
#
# ==== Template management for Elasticsearch 5.x
# Index template for this version (Logstash 5.0) has been changed to reflect Elasticsearch's mapping changes in version 5.0.
# Most importantly, the subfield for string multi-fields has changed from `.raw` to `.keyword` to match ES default
# behavior.
#
# ** Users installing ES 5.x and LS 5.x **
# This change will not affect you and you will continue to use the ES defaults.
#
# ** Users upgrading from LS 2.x to LS 5.x with ES 5.x **
# LS will not force upgrade the template, if `logstash` template already exists. This means you will still use
# `.raw` for sub-fields coming from 2.x. If you choose to use the new template, you will have to reindex your data after
# the new template is installed.
#
# ==== Retry Policy
#
# The retry policy has changed significantly in the 2.2.0 release.
# This plugin uses the Elasticsearch bulk API to optimize its imports into Elasticsearch. These requests may experience
# either partial or total failures.
#
# The following errors are retried infinitely:
#
# - Network errors (inability to connect)
# - 429 (Too many requests) and
# - 503 (Service unavailable) errors
#
# NOTE: 409 exceptions are no longer retried. Please set a higher `retry_on_conflict` value if you experience 409 exceptions.
# It is more performant for Elasticsearch to retry these exceptions than this plugin.
#
# ==== Batch Sizes ====
# This plugin attempts to send batches of events as a single request. However, if
# a request exceeds 20MB we will break it up until multiple batch requests. If a single document exceeds 20MB it will be sent as a single request.
#
# ==== DNS Caching
#
# This plugin uses the JVM to lookup DNS entries and is subject to the value of https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/net/properties.html[networkaddress.cache.ttl],
# a global setting for the JVM.
#
# As an example, to set your DNS TTL to 1 second you would set
# the `LS_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable to `-Dnetworkaddress.cache.ttl=1`.
#
# Keep in mind that a connection with keepalive enabled will
# not reevaluate its DNS value while the keepalive is in effect.
#
# ==== HTTP Compression
#
# This plugin supports request and response compression. Response compression is enabled by default and 
# for Elasticsearch versions 5.0 and later, the user doesn't have to set any configs in Elasticsearch for 
# it to send back compressed response. For versions before 5.0, `http.compression` must be set to `true` in 
# Elasticsearch[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-http.html#modules-http] to take advantage of response compression when using this plugin
#
# For requests compression, regardless of the Elasticsearch version, users have to enable `http_compression` 
# setting in their Logstash config file.
