      # From Logstash 1.3 onwards, a template is applied to Elasticsearch during
      # Logstash's startup if one with the name `template_name` does not already exist.
      # By default, the contents of this template is the default template for

      # `logstash-*`.  Should you require support for other index names, or would like
      # to change the mappings in the template in general, a custom template can be
      # specified by setting `template` to the path of a template file.
      #
      # Setting `manage_template` to false disables this feature.  If you require more
      # control over template creation, (e.g. creating indices dynamically based on
